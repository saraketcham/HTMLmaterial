    <h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>This is a Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Smallest Heading (6)</h4><h4>Headings are blocks that display on their own line</h4>
    <!-- Experiment what - what is the smallest heading number? What happens if you try <h100> which is clearly not a real thing?  -->

    <!-- Check out how this part looks in the browser or preview -->
    This is a bunch of untagged text
    Because it is untagged there won't be any separation

    Even if I put a space above this.

    You see what I mean?
    This is all a continuous paragraph.

    <!-- P TAGS! -->
    <p>With paragraph tags I can create separation</p>
    <p> Next paragraph please!</p>
    <!-- Go back and add some <p> and </p> tags to break up the preceeding text -->
    <!-- Experiment! What happens if you use just an opening tag, or just a closing tag? -->


    <!-- IN-LINE TAGS-->
    <p>New semantics: <strong>strong</strong> <em>emphasized</em></p>
    <!-- Can you figure out how to make something bold AND italicized? -->

    <!-- LOREM -->
    <!--  Use lorem+Tab or lorem+Enter  to  quickly get filler text! Try it out-->
